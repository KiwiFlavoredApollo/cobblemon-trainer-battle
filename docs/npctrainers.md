# NPC Trainers

NPC trainers make Cobblemon experience more interesting. Players must have VS Seeker in their inventories in order to spawn trainers around them. NPC Trainers can either be spawned with Trainer Spawn Eggs or with following commands.

```
/summon cobblemontrainerbattle:trainer ~ ~ ~ {trainer:"radicalred/leader_brock",texture:"minecraft:textures/entity/player/slim/steve.png"}
```
